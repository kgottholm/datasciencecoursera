Code Book

This code book includes information about the source data, the transformations performed after collecting the data and some information about the variables of the resulting data sets.
Study Design

The source data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to complete an assignment for a Coursera course named Getting and Cleaning Data instructed by Jeff Leek. The assignment involved working with the data set and producing tidy data representation of the source data. Below is a list of the operations done to achieve the outputs.

This course is part of the Data Science Track.

Steps Performed:

	point to working directory where files have been downloaded to
	Include the data.table library
	Load the three train .txt files with column names
	Load the three test .txt files with column names
	load the features.txt
	load activites with column names
	rename the activity Name for easier readablity
	combin the y_data, x_data and the subject data
	transpose(reshape) the features row names to column names, to be used as heading
	determine which columns are for mean() and std()
	isolate the required columns
	create and write the resulting tidy data
	create a data.table for the calculated columns and group by subject and the activity description
	write the calculated table
